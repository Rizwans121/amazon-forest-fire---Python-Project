Name of the project:- Amazon forest fire in Brazil

Description/Summary

This project is about analyzing the forest fire which takes place often at the
largest forest of the world, which is amazon forest, it is situated in
Brazil which is in the southern area of South American continent.
This project will help in analyzing the situation of forest fires happening,
Everyone can look at this analysis and get an idea about the condition.
This analysis is reported according to the states of the country of Brazil by 
the span of 19 years i.e. from 1998 to 2017.


*What have i done?

I have used the most used functions of python which is:-
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib


*Why I have choosen this project?

As we experienced that how horrible year 2020 was, we experienced every unexpected
things last year, one of the things we experienced was amazon bushfires,
It affected almost the whole Country of Brazil and the world 
and the people living there, it affected the aazon forest biodiversity
and killed many forest insect species and 2.3 million animals,
that was very tragic, so that is the reason why i decided to choose this topic.


*what is the conclusion?

Forest fires cause a significant environmental damage while threatening human lives.
In the last two decades, a substantial effort was made to build automatic
detection tools that could assist Fire Management System. 
This data was collected from several websites, news articles, satellite data and public forums.
This project was aimed to inform and show analysis on forest fires which happens
at amazon forest by dividing the analysis into showing the effect on states, cities, years,
months and area.


*What are the steps taken for conclusion and why?

I used numpy, pandas and matplotlib for the analysis of amazon forestfires.
I used numpy because it provides array objects and tools for project
I used pandas because it provides various set of functions to process
various types of data
I used matplotlib because it is very useful in making line plots,
bar graphs, pie charts and many other types of datasets.
